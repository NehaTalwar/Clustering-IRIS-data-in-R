# Clustering-IRIS-data-in-R
Clustering with the K-Means algorithm on IRIS data with R.

Description

This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
Iris is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species.
I have used K-Means to divide the data in to 3 clusters and used ggplot to show the scatterplot.
It is an Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm
Essence of Clustering is grouping objects in a way that objects in same cluster are similar to each other than objects in different cluster.
It is Mainly used in Exploratory Data Analysis.
K-Means Clustering uses Centroid Based Clustering Algorithm
